# Abstract:

Home automation is becoming more and more popular these days. Smart lights, Fan, Refrigerator are gradually turning into crucial parts of our day to day Usage. 
To develop a smart switch prototype to replace ordinary switches is the project goal. An easy to control smart switch system with minimal bugs is the ultimate goal.
The system allows users to control the appliances with the help of a smart switch with ease, helping in reducing the need to physically alter the switches, 
The System also shares data throughout the communication in the patterns that are encrypted increasing security. 
The final prototype designed in this project uses a smart switch to turn on and off home Lights, Fans and Refrigerators has a user interface panel with some buttons,
switches allowing one to have complete control over the appliance with ease.

# Introduction:

For this project, the team created a smart switch system for controlling the appliance like fans, lights, refrigerators.
With conventional lights, fans, refrigerators it is not possible to control home appliances from a distance.  
Smart switch systems that learn the patterns for home appliance usage do not exist. A significant amount of energy
is wasted when lights, fans,are left on in unoccupied rooms.Home automation has become much more practical. 
Smart switch system is a key component for upcoming traits in society. There exist many versions of smart switches that comein various forms 
bulbs, fans, refrigerator. Existing smart switch systems typically feature control from smartphones.
The project leads to an enhancement of home automation by using smart switch. The home devices can be operated and sensors can be read through PC,
tablets, mobiles or WiFi. Automation is taking place in common day to day life as compared to older days of manual ON/OFFprocedures. It also reduces
the tragedies like electric sparks and short circuit. With the help of Wi-Fitechnology automations adds the values and used for controlling the home appliances.
